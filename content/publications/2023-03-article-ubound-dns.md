In March 2023, I wrote a blog post on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) titled "Um servidor DNS Recursivo rápido, seguro e escalável (A Fast, Secure, and Scalable Recursive DNS Server)." The post talks about Unbound, Recursive DNS, and best practices in security, while also providing guidance on creating your own DNS.

- It received more than 1k views across all platforms,
- It was re-published on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unbound-um-servidor-dns-recursivo-r%C3%A1pido-seguro-e-escal%C3%A1vel-borges/),
