The book [Demystifying Prometheus](https://livro.descomplicandoprometheus.com.br/) is a crucial component of the [Demystifying Prometheus training](https://www.linuxtips.io/course/descomplicando-prometheus) offered by [LINUXtips](https://www.linuxtips.io/quem-somos).

I contributed to the development of the ebook version, implementing new features and making corrections to links, texts, and titles.
