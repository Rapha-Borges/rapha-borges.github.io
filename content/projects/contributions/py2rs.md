[py2rs](https://github.com/rochacbruno/py2rs) is a quick reference guide for the Pythonista in process of becoming a Rustacean.

In a conversation with [Bruno Rocha](https://github.com/rochacbruno), I discovered his need to implement an ebook in a project of his that facilitates the migration of Python developers to the Rust language. Since I had already developed the [mdbookcli](https://github.com/Rapha-Borges/mdbookcli) tool, I implemented this tool to generate the [book](https://rochacbruno.github.io/py2rs/).
