While working on the implementation of the "[Demystifying Prometheus](https://livro.descomplicandoprometheus.com.br/)" book from [LINUXtips](https://www.linuxtips.io/quem-somos), I noticed the need to simplify the process and address certain limitations in the default [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) interface.

The [mdBookCLI](https://github.com/Rapha-Borges/mdbookcli) introduces multilingual support in a manner distinct from the standard mdBook, generating a homepage that allows users to choose their preferred language. Additionally, it includes extra customizations not available in the default mdBook version.
