      <description>In 2020, while building Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s new Continuous Delivery platform, I found myself needing a tool to automate the creation of pull requests to implement our Gitops-based workflow. No existing tool really matches our needs, so I created Octopilot: a CLI tool designed to help you automate your Gitops workflow, by automatically creating and merging GitHub Pull Requests to update specific content in Git repositories.
You can read more about Octopilot in a blog post I wrote on Medium: Introducing Octopilot: a CLI to automate the creation of GitHub pull requests in your gitops workflow.</description>

      <description>I started using Jenkins X in 2018, and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing to the project.
Since 2020, I started contributing more to Jenkins X by creating new components, mainly for observability - but also web UIs.
JX Pipelines Visualizer The first new project I created for Jenkins X was the JX Pipelines Visualizer: a web UI to visualize the pipelines and their logs.
New @jenkinsxio UI to visualize your pipelines and logs: https://t.</description>

      <description>In 2015-2016, while using OpenShift, I developed a few small open-source projects on top of the Kubernetes/OpenShift APIs:
 OpenShift Dashboard OpenShift Cucumber OpenShift GitHub Hooks OpenShift/Git Integration OpenShift Flowdock Notifier  OpenShift Dashboard When I started using OpenShift, I quickly realized that it was missing a global view of the cluster state. In August 2015 I developed a Web Dashboard for visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift.
This gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.</description>
