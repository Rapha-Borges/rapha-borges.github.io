Due to these typical limitations of a local cluster, I went looking for a cost-free alternative. While there was some material talking about the creation of a cluster, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any that were up-to-date and easily replicable. For this reason, I decided to utilize the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with its Always Free resources to launch the OKE-FREE project during the #MÃªsDoKubernetes by Linuxtips.</description></item></channel></rss>
