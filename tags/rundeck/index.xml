      <title>Jenkins Rundeck Plugin</title>

      <description>In 2011, I wrote a Jenkins plugin to integrate Rundeck as a &amp;ldquo;publisher&amp;rdquo;: the Rundeck plugin.
This plugin allows the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, using Jenkins to build your software and Rundeck to deploy it. I talked about it at the Paris DevOps meetup in march 2011: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck.
Note that this plugin is now maintained by the Rundeck team, and is still used by many people.</description>

      <title>Rundeck API Java Client</title>

      <description>In 2011, following the Jenkins Rundeck plugin, I extracted the code that talked to the Rundeck REST API into its own project: the Rundeck API Java Client.
The goal was to be able to write more software in Java using Rundeck&amp;rsquo;s REST API, for example the Rundeck Remote CLI, or writing scripts
Note that this project is now maintained by the Rundeck team at rundeck/rundeck-api-java-client, and is still used by many projects/people.</description>
